# JavaScript Projects

This repository showcases various practice projects using JavaScript, part of my journey in learning the language.  
> **"The best way to learn something is by doing it!"**

Each project focuses on different JavaScript concepts and practical use cases. I document my learnings and ideas in **Notion**, where I take detailed notes and track my progress. All will be implemented using Flask.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Flask
- Postgresql
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

### Project Sources
The project ideas are primarily inspired by:
* [freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#heading-how-to-create-a-review-carousel)
* [John Smilga's JavaScript Basic Projects Repository](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/tree/master)

## Projects

### Reviews corousel

This project demonstrates building an interactive review carousel that cycles through user reviews. It teaches key JavaScript concepts like working with objects and arrays to structure data, `DOMContentLoaded` for initializing content on page load, and `addEventListener()` for handling button clicks to navigate between reviews. It also covers array manipulation with boundary checks using `array.length` and updating HTML elements dynamically with `textContent` to display the data. This provides practical insights into combining JavaScript and HTML for dynamic, user-driven interfaces.

### Filter

This project showcases creating a user filter feature by dynamically fetching and rendering data from an API using JavaScript. It demonstrates DOM manipulation (creating and modifying elements), event handling (filtering user data based on input), styling with CSS (hiding elements with classes and customizing the list), and asynchronous programming with `fetch` for API integration. These concepts illustrate how to build interactive and responsive web applications.

### Tab section

This project features a tab navigation system where users can switch between different content sections and images. In JavaScript, an event listener is added to each tab link (`.nav-link`) using `addEventListener("click", (e) => { ... })`. When a tab is clicked, the function prevents the default link behavior with `e.preventDefault()`. It then uses `forEach()` to loop through all tab links, content sections (`.content`), and images (`.image`), removing the `active` and `live` classes with `classList.remove()`, hiding all content and images. The `classList.add()` method is then used to add the `active` class to the clicked tab and the `live` class to the corresponding content and image, ensuring only the selected tab’s content is displayed.

### To-Do List App

Concepts: Arrays, local storage, CRUD operations, event handling.
Description: A basic to-do app where users can add, remove, and edit tasks. You’ll learn how to store data locally in the browser, making the app persistent across page reloads.
Why useful: Building this app gives you experience with data management and forms, which are essential for any task management or productivity app.

### Postgrade in Flask



### Weather App (with API Integration)

Concepts: Fetch API, promises, asynchronous JavaScript, DOM updates.
Description: A weather app that fetches data from a weather API and displays current weather information. You'll learn how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous code, and update the DOM with dynamic data.
Why useful: Working with APIs is a vital skill in modern web development. Many websites and apps rely on third-party data, and understanding how to fetch and display this data will help you build dynamic applications.


### ask Management App (with Drag and Drop)

Concepts: Drag-and-drop functionality, local storage, event handling, dynamic content updates.
Description: This project involves building a task management system where tasks can be added, dragged between columns (e.g., to-do, in-progress, completed), and saved across page reloads using local storage.
Why useful: Task management apps are common in project management or productivity tools. Understanding drag-and-drop interfaces and managing state locally is a crucial skill for building interactive, user-centric applications.


### Real-time Chat Application (using WebSocket or Firebase)

Concepts: Real-time data, event handling, WebSocket/Firebase API, dynamic DOM updates.
Description: A real-time chat app where users can send and receive messages instantly. You'll learn how to integrate WebSocket or Firebase to manage real-time communication between users.
Why useful: Real-time communication is key in modern web applications (messaging apps, live notifications). This project will teach you how to manage live updates and work with real-time data streams.
