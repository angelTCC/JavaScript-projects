# JavaScript Projects

This repository showcases various practice projects using JavaScript, part of my journey in learning the language.  
> **"The best way to learn something is by doing it!"**

Each project focuses on different JavaScript concepts and practical use cases. I document my learnings and ideas in **Notion**, where I take detailed notes and track my progress. All will be implemented using Flask.

### Project Sources
The project ideas are primarily inspired by:
* [freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#heading-how-to-create-a-review-carousel)
* [John Smilga's JavaScript Basic Projects Repository](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/tree/master)
